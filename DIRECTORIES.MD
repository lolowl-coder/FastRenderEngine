**ARE directory structure:**

- External - external libraries
- Samples - sample applications that use FRE
- Samples/App - example of engine usage
- Samples/App/AppLib - application library
- Samples/App/App - application executable
- Src - FRE sources
- Src/Include - FRE headers
- Tools - FRE common tools

It is highly recommended to break Sample application that uses FRE into libraries and executable.
This approach simplifies testing and will make your application modular.
